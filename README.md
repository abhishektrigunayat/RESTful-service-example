An simple example of a RESTful service API implementation in Java.  The client is an html file that invokes a RESTful service, deployed on a server, and implemented using java servlets. Various HTTP methods viz GET, PUT, POST, DELETE can be chosen to invoke the service. The user needs to give an employee id and the service is used to read, create, update or delete the employee name corresponding to that employee id. The message returned by the service is in form of a text and is diplayed to the client in raw format. The data is stored inside the application and is non persistent in nature.
